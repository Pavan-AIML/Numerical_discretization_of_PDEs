<h1>Numerics_discretization_of predator, pre differential equations.</h1> 
<h2 align =center> I have implemented the following methods in this project. </h2> 

- Euler's method -
- Modified Euler's method
- Heun's method to discretize the PDE.
  
<h3> The Differential equation is given below. </h3>
<p align = center> b' = lambda_b*b*(1-r/r_e)</p>
<p align = center >  r' = lambda_r * r * (b/b_e -1) </p>
